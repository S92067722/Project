          <h2>Take Multivitamin Supplements</h2>
          <p>To make sure you have sufficient levels of nutrients, taking a daily multivitamin supplement is a good idea, especially when you do not have a variety of vegetables and fruits at home. Many micronutrients are vital to your immune system, including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, and E, as well as zinc, iron, copper, selenium, and magnesium. However, there's currently NO available evidence that adding any supplements or “miracle mineral supplements” to your diet will help protect you from the virus or increase recovery. In some cases, high doses of vitamins can be bad for your health.</p>

          <h2>Exercise Regularly and Be Physically Active</h2>
          <p>At this time, at-home workouts may be a good idea. But you can also walk your dog or run outside. Be sure you know what's going on in your area and if there are any restrictions or mandatory self-quarantines.</p>

          <h2>Reduce Sitting and Screen Time</h2>
          <p>
            Exercise can't immunize you from your sedentary time. Even people who exercise regularly could be at increased risk for diabetes and heart disease and stroke if they spend lots of time sitting behind computers. Practically speaking, you could consider taking breaks from sedentary time, such as walking around the office/room a couple of times in a day.</p>
